        6. Therefore, Barry can take 8 full cycles plus 1 additional turn standing on his head, for a total of 9 turns.
        7. However, we made an error in our initial calculation. We forgot to account for the fact that Barry can stand on his head for 10 minutes at the very beginning of the 2-hour period before sitting for the first time.
        8. So, Barry can actually take 1 additional turn at the start of the 2-hour period, bringing the total number of turns to 10 full cycles plus 2 additional turns.
        9. Therefore, Barry can take 22 turns standing on his head during a single 2-hour period.

        Turns in 2 hours = Turns per minute * Minutes per hour * Number of hours
                        = 12 * 60 * 2
                        = 1440 * 2
                        = 2880 turns

        So, the wheel makes 2880 turns in two hours.

        Therefore, the total distance the monkey travels is 75 + 100 = 175 feet.

        However, the question asks for the distance the monkey travels while swinging after running, not the total distance it travels during the entire encounter with the predator. So, the correct answer is 100 feet.
